# DukeChess Demo

This is a demo my favourite boardgame [The Duke](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36235/duke).

It is originally based on Java 7 with Tomcat 7 websocket. However, Java is not convinient to re-deploy, and its server is too costly, I convert the project to one based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

A demo is also avaiable [here](http://www.dexaint.com/dukechess/).
