    noteContent: "This is just an example note which was created with Note Library.
      You can add new notes by using <b>Tools > DreamOS > Show Note Library</b>.
      \n\nIf you want, you can also create a new note by clicking to the button on
      the left bar.\n\nSince notes are managed by scriptable objects, new notes created
      outside the editor won't be stored.\n\nNote content can be changed by clicking
      this area. The title can be also edited in the same way."
